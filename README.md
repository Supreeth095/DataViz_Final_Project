# Project

The final project for CPSC8040, Fall 2019. Create a static infographic with Tableau.

### Dataset

Download the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11rAN5xuxRywaR9PoEP1hXf8Xl0cWoF1s/view?usp=sharing)

Notice - this is not a publicly available dataset. You are allowed to use the dataset and you can share the results of your project but you are not allowed to share the dataset elsewhere.

The dataset is a collection of geolocations describing the movements of a person from ~2014 to 2019. The dataset contains the following attributes:
- Activity: a value identifying the type of activity/movement performed by the person as recorder by the Google Maps API
- Date: date of when the event was recorded
- Hour: time of the day when the event was recorded
- City: City where the person was
- County: County where the person was
- State: State where the person was
- Country: Country where the person was



### Dashboard 1:


In this Dashboard we explore more about the person's place in USA and where his home/work might be. 


This dashboard consists of 4 images:

 Image 1: Heat Map of Countries Visited. 

It shows all the countries the person has visited since 2014. The darker shade indicates more activity in that place. 

We can see that the 2 main contries visited by this person are : 
USA and Italia

 Image 2:

Density Map of the States he has visited within the USA. 

We can see that the states the person has visited over the years and we can guess where he lived at a particular time, using the Density. More Density would mean home state. 


 Image 3:

Bubble Map of the Counties he has visited within the USA. 

We can see that the Counties the person has visited over the years and we can guess in which county he lived in based on the bubble size. As we can see Prince George's county is the biggest bubble. So his home is probably in Prince George's county.

 Image 4:

Tree Map of the cities he has visited within the USA. 

We can see that the cities the person has visited over the years and we can guess in which city he lived in based on the square size. As we can see College Park is the biggest square. So his home and work is probably in College Park city.

So, in this Dashboard we explore more about the person's place in USA and where his home/work might be.

### Dashboard 2:

In this Dashboard we explore more about the person's Travel Habits in Italia including place of stay, etc. .


This dashboard consists of 4 images:

 Image 1: GIF of Countries Visited over time. 
It shows all the countries the person has visited since 2014. The good thing about this is that it establishes a Timeline of all of the person's travel

We can see that the 2 main contries visited by this person are : 
USA and Italia.

We have Established that this person stays and works in the USA. However we can see that he visits Italy often
So, in this Dashboard we explore more about the person's Travel Habits in Italia including place of stay, etc. .


 Image 2:

Tree Map of the States he has visited in Italy. 

We can see that the states the person has visited in Italy and we can guess where he always visits which one particilar state based on the square size. As we can see Liguria is the biggest square. Meaning, when he visits Italy, he always stays in Liguria state. 

 Image 3:

Bar graph of the cities he has visited within Italy. 

We can see that acitivity count in the cities the person has visited in Italy.We can guess that , Since Genova is really high in value compared to the other cities in Italy, He always Visits Genova when he travels to Italy.

Image 4:

Bubble Map of the Months Spent in Italy 

We can see that the months that the person has visited Italy in over the years. We can notice a trend that he usually visitis Italy in : 
Winter :
December 
,January
,Febraury

And Summer:
May
,June
,July 

So, in this Dashboard we explore more about the person's affinity with Italy and where his native city might be in Italy and the months he likes to travel to Italy.

### Dashboard 3:

In this Dashboard we explore more about the person's habits and activities. 


This dashboard consists of 4 images:
Image 1: Hour wise on-foot Activity

We can see that the person is least active between 1am to 5am and most active at 7am in the USA. 

Image 2:
Comparison of activity in the person's two favorite cities. 

Image 3:
Traveling pattern of the person in USA

He travels a lot in the morning at 9am . (Probably to Work)
Is still for a while. 

Travels a lot after 6pm and travels the most at 7 pm. (Probably reaches home by this time). After which the activity reduces significantly. 


Image 4:
Activity count over the years - Different type of Activity

Can see that the person prefers on-foot more than bicycle. 
Also can notice that the in-vehicle travel has increased significantly since 2018 and on-foot has decreased since 2018. Probably he has been travelling to work in vehicle since 2017. 


So, In this Dashboard we explore more about the person's habits and activities. 
We understand when he is most active and when he is least active. 
We understand that he has been opting for vehicle transport instead of on foot more since 2018. 
We understand other habits such as travel timings (perhaphs to and from work).

### Instructions

Create a single infographic including 3 figures created with tableau. Each figure can be composed of multiple views. The infographic can be assembled either inside Tableau or by using a vector graphic software like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.

Each figure should show an interesting pattern or something you have discovered by visually analyzing the dataset. For example, where the person used to leave, work, what are her/his abhits, etc.

You are not allowed to use the same visualization idiom twice (i.e., if your main image in figure 1 has a bar chart, you are not allowed to use a bar chart for the remaining figures).


### Submission

Upload the final infographic created plus all the material used to generate it (workbook, svg or ia files, text files, etc.)

### The Tableau Work book containing all the Dashboards has been uploaded.

### Grade

An infographic should be a self-contained story speaking mainly with images. You are allowed to use text to fill the holes between one figure and another and to provide the narrative.

The overall infographic can score 15 points (5x3 points).
For each figure you can collect:
- 1.5 points, Effective. The image and the associated text contains an effective description of the pattern you have found
- 2 points, Efficiency. By using the figure a user can intuitively see the behavior/pattern you are talking about.
- 1.5 points, Style. The images are well organized, well-formatted and the font and colors are consistent and visually appealing. Legend and titles are visible, etc.

Bonus points.
If you score 15/15 and your infographic is jaw-dropping you will get 5 bonus points. To get these I need to be impressed by how you choose your visualization for building the story. On top of that, you need to have a perfectly formatted and appealing infographic.

### Hint

When using maps you will notice that Tableau does not recognize a lot of the locations provided since it assumes you are referring to locations in the US only. By clicking on the unknown fields (shown on screen in the lower right corner) you can fix this by using table names for interpreting the Country, State, City of each point. You will still get a few points as unknown. You can just ignore them.
